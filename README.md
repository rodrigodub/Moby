# Moby
*Moby is a sailing simulator.*
The system will simulate the basics of sailing. 

## The sailboat
- Sail, Tiller and Rudder, Hull and Keel
- Heading
- Sail Angle: Relative and Absolute

## The wind
- The sailing recipe
- Wind-Force
- Sail-Force
- Keel-Force
- Forward-Force
- Drag

### Sailing Objective
Optimize forward-force while moving toward the target by determining the optimal sail angle and rudder direction.

### Simulator Objective
Sail across the world over real satellite imagery. Record visited places on a virtual GPS log.
